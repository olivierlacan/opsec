## Operational Security

### What is OpSec?

It's a term usually employed in information security circles and by the
intelligence (the spying kind) community.

In the simplest terms, OpSec revolves around the operational practices
you can use to keep yourself and your information safe from a wide range
of potential threats.

### Do I need OpSec?

Information security folks like to talk about **threat modeling**. It's
easy to mistakenly think that you are not important enough to be at
risk. You might imagine that only large corporations are worth a
malicious hacker's time. It may have been true when the cost of
exploiting vulnerabilities in electronic hardware and software was high
and the number of capable attackers low. These days, the means to
attack are cheap, there are many more capable attackers, and most of the
world is interconnected via the Internet.

So yes, to varying degrees, everybody needs to worry about operational
security to some extent.

### How do I protect myself?

As I mentioned above, it's always a good first step to imagine what
threats could face you. This may be difficult when you're not familiar
with the universe of information security, so this is what I hope to
help you with.
